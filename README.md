# No-Relational DB Lab

## AIM

In this lab we will explore differences and similarities between relational and no relational databases, and how mondern frameworks let us work with different databases with almost no changes in the code.

## Start here your setup

We will need in our laptop:

- [JDK 8 or 11 instalado](https://www.oracle.com/es/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- Config [JAVA_HOME](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html) varialble properly.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 
- [Opcional] An IDE to simplify our work. Such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as container manager. You can find some help to install it in [windows install](./instalacionDockerWindows/README.md)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) As code repository.
- [DB client] You will need a db client to access both PostgreSQL and MongoDB. You can use [Squlrrel-sql](http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/#installation).
